# owBot

A very cool Discord bot for Overwatch!

(public version of my private bot)

## Set Up & Requirements

#### Requirements
- NodeJS (Latest Version Recommended)

#### Set Up
- Clone repository 
- Run "npm install" inside terminal
- Enter bot token inside src/config.json

### NOTE: I will most likely transition this to a stats bot once an API is available.
